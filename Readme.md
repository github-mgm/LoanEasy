Right now, we are building a Loan Aggregator website. 

So the question is, what is a Loan Aggregator website?

I, Mahak Goyal, came up with this term which means it accumulates loans. 

The major idea behind this, or we can say, the problem statement we have is how to simplify the journey of taking a  loan. The loan could be of any type, such as a home loan, car loan, gold loan, etc.

The major problem customers face is, that the person has to go to each bank or each bank's website to get the quotation of each bank or the very same profile, and depending on the bank the loan amount and loan interest can vary a lot. The number of problems that I have identified are as follows:

- The person who wants to take a loan has to do intensive research that how many institutes (banks and NBFCs) provide a certain type of loan?
- How many institutes are available in a particular area?
- How much an institute can offer for the same profile?

The 3rd point here is the main thing that we want to solve. A person at the age of 30 with a decent job and No prior loans will receive a better loan quotation than a person who is 55 with an OKish business even if both of them have the same CIBIL score. Also, different Institutes have different risks. like SBI will offer less amount of loan compared to any other NBFCs for the same person. 

So the solution to this is to get a user to log in on our website and enter the information such as name, location, and CIBIL score. and let's say the customer expresses interest in a personal Loan Once we create the profile of a particular user, based on his location we can list out the institutes which offer personal loans and how much those institutes offer for that person. 

So it will fast track the decision to choose a Bank or any NBFC of the users.
